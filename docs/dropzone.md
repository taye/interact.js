title: Dropzone
---

Dropzones define elements that draggable targets can be "dropped" into and which
elements will be accepted. Like with drag events, drop events don't modify the
DOM to re-parent elements. You will have to do this in your own event listeners
if you need this.

```javascript
interact(dropTarget)
  .dropzone({
    ondrop: function (event) {
      alert(event.relatedTarget.id
            + ' was dropped into '
            + event.target.id)
    }
  })
  .on('dropactivate', function (event) {
    event.target.classList.add('drop-activated')
  })
```

## Dropzone Events

Dropzone events are plain objects with the following properties:

| Property        | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `target`        | The dropzone element                            |
| `dropzone`      | The dropzone Interactable                       |
| `relatedTarget` | The element that's being dragged                |
| `draggable`     | The Interactable that's being dragged           |
| `dragEvent`     | The related drag event – `drag{start,move,end}` |
| `timeStamp`     | Time of the event                               |
| `type`          | The event type                                  |

```javascript
interact('.dropzone').dropzone({
  accept: '.drag0, .drag1',
});
```

## `accept`

The dropzone `accept` option is a CSS selector or element which must match the
dragged element in order for drop events to be fired.

```javascript
interact(target).dropzone({
  overlap: 0.25
});
```

The `overlap` option sets how drops are checked for. The allowed values are:

- `'pointer'` – the pointer must be over the dropzone (default)
- `'center'` – the draggable element's center must be over the dropzone
- a number from 0-1 which is the (intersection area) / (draggable area). e.g.
  `0.5` for drop to happen when half of the area of the draggable is over the
  dropzone

## `checker`

The `checker` option is a function that you set to additionally check if a
dragged element can be dropped into a dropzone.

```javascript
interact(target).dropzone({
  checker: function (
    dragEvent,         // related dragmove or dragend
    event,             // Touch, Pointer or Mouse Event
    dropped,           // bool default checker result
    dropzone,          // dropzone Interactable
    dropElement,   // dropzone element
    draggable,         // draggable Interactable
    draggableElement   // draggable element
  ) {

    // only allow drops into empty dropzone elements
    return dropped && !dropElement.hasChildNodes();
  }
});
```

The checker function takes the following arguments:

| Arg                | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `dragEvent`        | related dragmove or dragend event                   |
| `event`            | The user move/up/end Event related to the dragEvent |
| `dropped`          | The value from the default drop checker             |
| `dropzone`         | The dropzone interactable                           |
| `dropElement`      | The dropzone element                                |
| `draggable`        | The Interactable being dragged                      |
| `draggableElement` | The actual element that's being dragged             |
