Draggable
=========

```html
<div class="draggable"> Draggable Element </div>
```

```css
.draggable {
  touch-action: none;
  user-select: none;
}
```

```js
const position = { x: 0, y: 0 }

interact('.draggable').draggable({
  listeners: {
    start (event) {
      console.log(event.type, event.target)
    },
    move (event) {
      position.x += event.dx
      position.y += event.dy

      event.target.style.transform =
        `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`
    },
  }
})
```

Dragging is the simplest action interact.js provides. To make an element
draggable, create an interactable with your desired target then call the
`draggable` method with the options that you need. In addition to the common
`InteractEvent` properties, `dragmove` events also have:

| `dragmove` property     | Description                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------|
| `dragEnter`             | The dropzone this Interactable was dragged over   |
| `dragLeave`             | The dropzone this Interactable was dragged out of |

<aside class="notice">
Remember to use CSS `touch-action: none` to prevent the browser from panning
when the user drags with a touch pointer, and `user-select: none` to disable
text selection.

`lockAxis` and `startAxis`
--------------------------

```javascript
// lock the drag to the starting direction
interact(singleAxisTarget).draggable({
  startAxis: 'xy'
  lockAxis: 'start'
});

// only drag if the drag was started horizontally
interact(horizontalTarget).draggable({
  startAxis: 'x'
  lockAxis: 'x'
});
```

There are two options for controlling the axis of drag actions: `startAxis` and
`lockAxis`.

`startAxis` sets the direction that the initial movement must be in for the
action to start. Use `'x'` to require the user to start dragging horizontally or
`'y'` to start dragging vertically.

`lockAxis` causes the drag events to change only in the given axis. If a value
of `'start'` is used, then the drag will be locked to the starting direction.

`cursorChecker`
---------------

```javascript
interact(target).draggable({
  cursorChecker: (action, interactable, element, interacting) => {
    switch (action.axis) {
      case 'x': return 'ew-resize'
      case 'y': return 'ns-resize'
      default: return interacting ? 'grabbing' : 'grab'
    }
  }
})
```

You can tell interact.js which cursor to set on the target with a
`cursorChecker` function.
